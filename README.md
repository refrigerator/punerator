Can't actually demo it online because you need to use a browser extension to enable Cross Origin Resource Scripting :( I hope to eventually rewrite it with a proper backend so that you don't need to use something hacky like this.

If you're really interested, you can just download the `index.html` file and open it up on your machine with a browser extension that allows CORS.
